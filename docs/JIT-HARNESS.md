# Task-Adaptive Harness Contract

## Purpose

This package expresses **Understand Onboard** as a typed, task-adaptive agent harness. Its concrete capability remains: Generate an evidence-backed onboarding guide from a repository and its operational surfaces. The harness contract makes memory, planning, action, capability selection, failure handling, and verification explicit.

This design is informed by the four-module factorization described in *JIT-Agent: Scaling Harness Intelligence via Just-in-Time Harness Evolution* (arXiv:2608.25593). It is an independent reference implementation of the interface pattern; it does not reproduce the paper's trained model, datasets, or reported benchmark results.

## Skill-specific module mapping

| Module | Strategy | Responsibility in Understand Onboard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Memory | `layered_working_context` | Retain repository map plus decisions, observations, and verification evidence needed to resume safely. |
| Planning | `layered_specification_plan` | Transform runtime surfaces into the ordered, bounded stages defined by this skill. |
| Capability | `task_conditioned_minimum_capability_set` | Expose only repository, runtime, and verification capabilities required by the bounded engineering task. |
| Action | `inspect_change_test_handoff` | Advance the workflow through domain concepts while preserving stop conditions and user authority. |

The dependency order is **Memory -> Planning -> Capability -> Action**. The action loop emits either a bounded operation or a terminal result, while the event history remains available for verification and repair.

## Operational stages

1. Identify entry points and ownership areas
2. Map build test and deployment paths
3. Extract domain vocabulary from code
4. Trace one end-to-end user flow
5. Document common failure surfaces
6. Assemble a role-aware onboarding path

## Failure and repair behavior

- Schema or interface failures may be repaired at most twice.
- Permission failures stop immediately without retry or escalation.
- Consequential operations require preview and authorization when applicable.
- Verification failures produce an incomplete receipt rather than a success claim.
- A repaired plan must pass the same validation gates as the original.

## Evidence and measurements

Expected skill-specific evidence:

- `Day 1 map`
- `First build`
- `Core flow`
- `Support playbook`

Candidate adapters should also record task success, verification-pass rate, tool-error rate, repair count, latency, and estimated cost. These fields support controlled comparisons between a fixed general harness and a task-adaptive harness without attributing another project's results to this repository.

## Run the executable contract

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_harness.py
python3 scripts/run_harness.py examples/task.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

The runner is deliberately side-effect free. It demonstrates validated module selection and produces a deterministic dry-run receipt. Connecting a real API, filesystem, model, browser, or creative runtime requires a separately reviewed adapter.

## Visual model

The existing [skill-specific system map](../assets/system-map.svg) shows the actual components and artifacts for this capability. It should be read together with the typed [manifest](../harness/manifest.json), which defines executable boundaries and evidence requirements.

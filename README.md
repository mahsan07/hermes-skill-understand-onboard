# Understand Onboard

> Generate an evidence-backed onboarding guide from a repository and its operational surfaces.

This repository packages a single, reusable Hermes skill as a documentation-first public reference. It explains the problem, operating contract, safety boundaries, expected evidence, and example usage without claiming a bundled runtime that is not present.

## Why this exists

Technical work becomes difficult to review when discovery, decisions, changes, and verification are mixed together. **Understand Onboard** turns that work into an explicit sequence with visible inputs, outputs, review points, and completion evidence.

## Why the repository has this name

The shared `hermes-skill-` prefix identifies this as a portable Hermes workflow package. `understand-onboard` names the capability directly—understand onboard—so the repository remains searchable and understandable outside the original AI-OS workspace. The public title is **Understand Onboard**.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | Engineering workflow packaged as a reusable Hermes `SKILL.md`. |
| What does it do? | Generate an evidence-backed onboarding guide from a repository and its operational surfaces. |
| Who is it for? | Builders, operators, and reviewers who want a repeatable, inspectable workflow. |
| What is delivered? | A skill contract, examples, safety guidance, release checks, and rendered SVG diagrams. |
| Runtime status | Documentation-first reference package; connect it to the tools available in your own environment. |

## Visual system map

The diagram below is specific to this capability. It shows the real components and artifacts involved rather than a generic agent loop.

## Operation sequence

![Understand Onboard actor and data sequence](assets/operation-sequence.svg)

1. Identify entry points and ownership areas
2. Map build test and deployment paths
3. Extract domain vocabulary from code
4. Trace one end-to-end user flow
5. Document common failure surfaces
6. Assemble a role-aware onboarding path

See [How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) for the component-by-component walkthrough and evidence model.

## Example visual output

This is an explanatory mockup of the output shape—not fabricated proof that a live run occurred. The labels show the information a real result should expose for review.

## Decision and stop conditions

![Decision guide for Understand Onboard](assets/decision-guide.svg)

## Inputs

- A bounded repository, diff, runtime, or engineering question
- Constraints such as allowed files, tools, and change scope
- Existing tests, logs, or acceptance criteria

## Outputs

- An evidence-backed finding, plan, review, or implementation
- Verification results and remaining risks
- A concise handoff another engineer can reproduce

## Example request

> Use a disposable sample repository to generate an evidence-backed onboarding guide from a repository and its operational surfaces. Return the result, the evidence used to verify it, and any limitations or actions that still require approval.

More scenarios and expected results are in [Examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md).

## Safety and trust model

This workflow may create or change artifacts, so consequential actions require a preview and explicit authorization. It must stop when ownership, authorization, target state, or publication safety is ambiguous. Never place credentials, private endpoints, personal data, or environment-specific secrets in the skill package or its evidence.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before connecting the workflow to real accounts, devices, repositories, or production data.

## What this repository does not claim

- It does not replace project-specific tests, code review, or production approval.
- It is not a hosted service, executable application, or vendor endorsement.
- It does not include credentials, private infrastructure, or the original personal AI-OS configuration.
- A successful example does not prove production readiness for every environment.

## Use this package

1. Read `SKILL.md` and confirm its trigger matches your task.
2. Copy the package into the skill location supported by your agent environment, or use it as a reference when authoring an equivalent workflow.
3. Replace tool assumptions with the tools actually available to you; do not add secrets to the repository.
4. Run the smallest safe example from `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.
5. Record verification evidence and review any consequential action before widening scope.

Improvements are welcome when they preserve narrow scope, honest capability claims, safe defaults, and reproducible verification. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
